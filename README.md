Project Description:
This is a basic calculator designed with a user-friendly theme. It allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also includes percentage (%), a clear (AC) button, a delete (DEL) button, and a decimal point (.).

How It Works:
The calculator layout is created using HTML.

CSS is used to give a modern dark-themed look with rounded buttons.

JavaScript (inline in HTML) handles button clicks and performs calculations.

Users can enter numbers and operators by clicking the buttons.

The "=" button calculates the result using eval().

The "AC" button clears everything, and the "DEL" button removes the last entered character.
